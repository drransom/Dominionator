# Dominionator
I didn't find any Dominion card selector apps that satisfied me, so I'm making my own.
This will be a browser-based, mobile-friendly app written entirely in Javascript.
I plan to use Twitter Bootstrap for styling. Key features to implement:

[] Includes all cards from all sets
[] Can select cards based on set
[] Can sort cards by multiple criteria (set, cost, box)
[] Calculates Platinum/Colony and Shelter
[] Veto cards once selected

### Bonus features:

[] Remember user preferences from session to session
[] Allow additional user restrictions regarding attack status
